With desperation comes productivity, and so did this way too simple portfolio (if you even can call it that) site. It was built using [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) which is always a delight ðŸ¤—

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build
```
