With desperation comes productivity, and so did this way too simple portfolio (if you even can call it that) site. It was built using [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) which is always a delight ðŸ¤—

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
