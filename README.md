Years has gone since I with desperation did anything with this way too simple portfolio (if you even can call it that) site. It was built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) which is always a delight ðŸ¤— and now it is time for version **2**.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:5173
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
